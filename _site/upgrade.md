Upgrading your Huawei phone to Android 10 involves a few steps. However, it's important to note that the availability of the update can depend on your specific phone model, region, and carrier. Here's a general guide on how to upgrade:

1. **Backup Your Data**: Before proceeding with any update, it's a good idea to back up your data. You can do this by using Huawei's built-in backup tool or by transferring files to a computer or cloud service.

2. **Check Device Compatibility**: Make sure your Huawei phone is eligible for the Android 10 update. You can usually find this information on Huawei's official website or through their customer support.

3. **Charge Your Phone**: Ensure your phone is fully charged or has at least 50% battery life. This prevents the phone from turning off during the update process, which could cause issues.

4. **Connect to Wi-Fi**: A stable Wi-Fi connection is recommended for downloading the update, as it can be quite large and might consume a lot of mobile data.

5. **Update Huawei's Software**: Sometimes, the phone's manufacturer needs to release software updates before Android updates can be installed. Check for any pending updates for your Huawei phone's software and install them.

6. **Check for Updates Manually**:
    - Go to your phone's "Settings".
    - Scroll down and select "System & updates".
    - Tap on "Software update".
    - Choose "Check for Updates". If an update is available, it will appear here.

7. **Download and Install the Update**: If the Android 10 update is available for your phone, you will see an option to download it. Tap on the download button and then install the update. Your phone will likely restart several times during this process.

8. **After the Update**: Once the update is installed, your phone will restart. It's normal for the phone to take longer to boot up after an update. Once it's on, go through the setup process, and check that all your apps and data are intact.

9. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues during or after the update, you can reach out to Huawei's customer support or visit a service center for assistance.

Remember that if your phone is an older model, it might not support the latest Android version. In such cases, considering a hardware upgrade might be more beneficial in the long run.
